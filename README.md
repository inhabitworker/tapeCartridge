 - spiral profile

# Target

- Same inter-spring band design
- Radial part includes the descending past x-axis
- Beyond point of intersection, there needs to only be enough space such that ingress can be covered, fully.
- Ingress is now fully inside the hoop. with a flat component following a 45deg angle.

- Lip spreaders or a taper on the now likely solid body of the center disc.

- The general thickness is defined overall, and only specific sections have a reduced "spring" thickness, namely the circular part past the intersection that then meets with the "encap".
    - this is where we want the bending to focus, by circular-ing it and having it slightly thinner. i think.

- Asymmetrical endcaps? maybe, maybe very likely. 
    - Ends that descend down forming a solid making the thing more resembling rectangle, and leaving clearance only for this ingress travel mentioned before.
    - "grippy" lines
    - extensions for balancing the tape for axis tangent to tape-circle.

- while the central disc is ostensibly solid, maybe not so much, or has varying thickness still. maybe it will construct such that the core bevels outward while remaining hollow (layers, two lines?). and have some interesting cuts.
- details cut and some hollowing (bridging/printing permitting) for the nice design.
